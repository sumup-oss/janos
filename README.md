## Overview
Janos will convert all your manifest files, updating it inplace. If you pass a directory as a parameter, it will do a recursive search. All comments are removed, and the file formatting may change.

## Installation

Build the image before running the script, because it will be executed inside the container.
```sh
# Build image
make build

# Copy entrypoint script to /usr/local/bin
make install
```

## Usage

```sh
janos {-d|-f}
-f file       The file to be converted.
-d dir        The directory with the yaml files to be converted.
```
All the rules are in the file migration.js.
